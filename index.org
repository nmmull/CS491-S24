This course is an introduction to basic concepts in type theory and
mechanized proof as they relate to programming languages, formal
verification, mathematics, and philosophy. We will only be able to
cover a (biased) selection of rudiments, but the goal is to provide
students (you) with the tools to:
+ construct formal proofs and typing derivations for a variety of
  logics and type theories which undergird systems used for large-scale
  verification tasks;
+ prove meta-theoretic properties of type theories (like normalization
  and soundness) which are core to their utility;
+ implement fundamental algorithms for type theories like
  type-checking and type-inference;
+ formalize non-trivial mathematical theorems and properties of
  programs using Agda;
+ prepare for graduate-level courses in formal methods and programming
  languages;
+ think critically about the fundamental question: /what is a proof?/
  Does a proof need to be human readable? Does it need to be human
  /understandable/? Does it need to be constructive? (What /is/ constructivity?)
